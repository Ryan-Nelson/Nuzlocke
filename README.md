# Nuzlocke is a Competitive Pokemon Tracking app built in React.js that allows users to keep track of their team and Pokemon.
When the user logs in they will see their home page. The user will be able to then add a new team. The user then will be taken to aÂ  form which was built using ReactStrap, in which the user will be asked to then enter the team name, the win-loss record, and the team description. The user is then taken back to the home screen, to which the can then edit their team, add a new Pokemon to the team. If the user has 6 Pokemon on a team they will not be able to add a new one to that team.
